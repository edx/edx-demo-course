<h2>Peer-Graded Essay</h2>
<p>Lastly, your course might use peer-graded essay assignments. &nbsp;One of the best ways to learn is to be exposed to other people's responses to a question that you have already thought critically about. Reading incorrect responses will make you more aware of many of the subtleties in a question that you might have otherwise taken for granted. Reading correct responses allows you to see different perspectives on the same question. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In some courses, several of these essays tools are used together to really provide a great learning experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How does the peer-grading tool work? &nbsp;There are three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Answer the question. Write a response to the prompt to the best of your ability.</li>
<li>Contributing to the student community: grade other people's responses. You will be provided with a rubric by the instructor, and asked to evaluate how other people's responses compare to the rubric. You can participate in this grading workflow by clicking on the "Open Ended Panel" option on the top of the screen, or by using the "Peer Grading" panel on this page below your submission.</li>
<li>After you have graded other student responses, your response will be included in the pool of responses to be graded, and other students will provide you with feedback on how you have done. You will see the results of the peer grading process in the same place in the courseware that you originally submitted your response.&nbsp;</li>
