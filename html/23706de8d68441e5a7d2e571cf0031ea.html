<p>This demo course is meant to show you the workflow of the edX essay grading options, not to make you write essays. If you don't want to compose your own essay, you can try these responses:</p>

<li>Books that are offensive should not be taken off the shelf all together, but should be put in a section made for adult readers only. This way no children would see the book anyway. If an offensive book is in a school or any other place that the readers are children for the majority than it should be ok to take that book off of the shelf. All together it should be ok to remove an offensive book from a shelf but only if the book is offencive to the wrong audience.</li>
<li>No, i do not think that books, magizines, movies and music should be removed. However, I do think that the books, magizines, movies, and music should be monitred by age. The reason why is because younger children sould not be reading , listening, or watching material that is for adults or teenagers. They way these type of things can be monitred is by the child's library card. The card could have their name, age, grade, and date of birth. If there is a certain book, magizine, movie, and music that the child want a parent has to be there with them. The parent needs to show a form of identification so that the librian knows that the parent is of age. Teenagers should also be moniterd. Event though they are almost adults. Some parents not agree with some of the material. So, if their parents does not want them reading certain things their should be stickers on their cards. Even though there are plenty of opinions about what a persons child is reading , watching, or listening to I think there should be certain ways to watch what children are reading, watching or listening to.</li>
<li>In libraries, there should not be censorship on materials considering that it's an individual's decision to read what they prefer. There is no appropriate standard on what makes a book offensive to a group, so it should be undetermined as to what makes a book offensive. In a public library, many children, who the books are censored for, are with their parents. Parents should make an independent choice on what they can allow their children to read. Letting society ban a book simply for the use of inappropriate materials is ridiculous. If an author spent time creating a story, it should be appreciated, and should not put on a list of no-nos. If a certain person doesn't like a book's reputation, all they have to do is not read it. Even in school systems, librarians are there to guide kids to read good books. If a child wants to read an inappropriate book, the librarian will most likely discourage him or her not to read it. In my experience, I wanted to read a book that my mother suggested to me, but as I went to the school library it turned out to be a censored book. Some parents believe children should be ignorant about offensive things written in books, but honestly many of the same ideas are exploited to them everyday on television and internet. So trying to shield your child from the bad things may be a great thing, but the efforts are usually failed attempts. It also never occurs to the people censoring the books, that some people can't afford to buy the books they want to read. The libraries, for some, are the main means for getting books. To conclude there is very little reason to ban a book from the shelves. Many of the books banned have important lessons that can be obtained through reading it. If a person doesn't like a book, the simplest thing to do is not to pick it up.</li>
